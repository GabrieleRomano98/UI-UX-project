# ChessMate

This project consists in the design of a UI, adopting a modern human-centered design process while building a web application to serve a set of target users. The goal is to build a useful, usable and used technology.

It was carried out in a 4-people team and is divided in 4 steps:

* **M1**: Definition of the users and of their needs
* **M2**: Design of a paper prototype, evaluated by another group
* **M3**: Design of medium-fidelity wireframe in Figma
* **M4**: Session of usability-testing with a working prototype (it is available in the Prototype folder)
